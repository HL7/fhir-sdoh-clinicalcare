      <p>This resource describes the required and desired behavior of systems acting as 'light-weight' SDOH clinical care 'referral recipients'.  These systems fit into the SDOH care workflow in the same manner as <a href="CapabilityStatement-SDOH-ClinicalCareReferralRecipient.html">'regular' Referral Recipients</a>, however they have simpler interface requirements reflecting the inability of the systems to store data locally and/or expose a FHIR service allowing access to that data.  'Light' referral recipients are not expected to expose any FHIR restful services.  Instead, they act as clients, querying for tasks on the initiating <a href="CapabilityStatement-SDOH-ClinicalCareReferralSource.html">Referral Sources</a> or <a href="CapabilityStatement-SDOH-ClinicalCareCoordinationPlatform.html">Coordination Platforms</a> and creating any resulting Procedure records within the server they received the request from.</p>
