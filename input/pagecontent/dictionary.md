### Data Dictionary Content

The Data Dictionary (DD) presents this IG's content in a format that may be more accessible than the default FHIR artifact pages. The DD is an Excel spreadsheet that lists mCODE data elements and some details about them. If there is a discrepancy between the Data Dictionary and the FHIR artifacts, the FHIR artifacts are taken as the source of truth.

The DD intentionally omits certain elements in FHIR that are not expected to be implemented. Please be aware of the following:

* **Profiles not shown in the DD:** Not all profiles used by an IG are included in the Data Dictionary. These profiles are not included in the DD because they are defined externally to this IG.

* **Data elements not shown in the DD:** Only elements marked as "Must Support"(MS) are included in data dictionary. These are elements that implementers may be expected to provide meaningful support for.   Some of the MS elements are inherited from US Core.
