### [Gravity Outline Home Page](index.html)
#### Overview
- Definition of SDOH
- Short Description of Gravity Project
- Supported Use Cases
  - Document SDOH data in conjunction with patient encounters with providers, payers, and community services
  - Document and track SDOH-related interventions to completion
  - Identify cohorts of individuals that have a common relationship to another entity (e.g., covered by the same payer) ==> IG doesn't do this.
- Core Activities Supported
  - Screening: This refers to activities where SDH data from individual patients are initially captured, whether through a self-administered, provider-administered, or health plan-administered questionnaire. These activities may also be repeated at certain intervals to monitor changes in social risks.
  - Assessment/Diagnosis: These include activities where providers (clinical and community-based) and health plans analyze the data obtained through screening to determine a patientâ€™s social risks and needs.
  - Treatment/Interventions: These refer to actions undertaken by providers (clinical and community-based) and health plans to help address identified social needs. These include referrals, case management, care planning, counseling and education, and provision of services and orders.
- What the IG Does and What Systems it Involves?
  - Establishes a framework for SDOH-related interventions including:
    - capture of survey data from validated instruments
    - mapping the answers from the surveys into observations, conditions, and goals using SDOH-relevant value sets
    - generating and monitoring referrals from providers and care coordinators to CBOs
    - capturing the results of the referrals as procedures
  - Systems
    - EHR
    - CP
    - CBO Systems
    - Patient Applications
    - Eventually Payer systems?
- Dependencies and Relationships to Other IGs
  - Dependencies:

    - BSER -- alternate referral workflow that will be harmonized
 - How to Read (each section with audience).  Roughly should be read front to back.

| --------| ----------- | --------- | ---------|
| Background| SDOH and Gravity | General background on the importance of collecting and standardizing SDOH data, and the Gravity Project     |  General |
| Background| SDOH Clinical Care Background | What is in and out of scope for this IG.  Shouldn't this be on the Home Page?     |  General |
| Background| [Functional Use Cases] |  This section provides a functional description of the interactions between the actors in an SDOH referral, and with links to the profiles and sections of the IG where more detail is provided. This should be read prior to the more detailed exchange workflow description.       |  General |
| Background| FHIR Technical | Background material that should be understood prior to attempting to understand this IG     |  General/Introductory |
| Implementation Guidance| [Standard Survey Instruments for SDOH (includes Mapping Instructions)] | The importance of standard survey instruments for the collection of SDOH, and how survey instruments are mapped to SDOH Conditions, Observations and Goals     |  General |
| Implementation Guidance|  [Referral Exchange Workflow] |  THis has three parts:  1) General description of Assess/Goals/Intervention workflow (should move to background) 2) Management of Consent (should move to separate section) 3) Detailed technical description of implementation of workflow using the IG's API  |  Detailed Technical |
| Implementation Guidance | [Synchronizing with Data Sources] | I'm not really sure what this is about     |  Detailed Technical  |

2. Standards for reporting quality measures
3. Addressing Consent beyond sharing to HIPPA
