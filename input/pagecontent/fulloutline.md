### [Gravity Outline Home Page](index.html)
#### Overview
- Definition of SDOH
- Short Description of Gravity Project
- Supported Use Cases
  - Document SDOH data in conjunction with patient encounters with providers, payers, and community services
  - Document and track SDOH-related interventions to completion
  - Identify cohorts of individuals that have a common relationship to another entity (e.g., covered by the same payer) ==> IG doesn't do this.
- Core Activities Supported
  - Screening: This refers to activities where SDH data from individual patients are initially captured, whether through a self-administered, provider-administered, or health plan-administered questionnaire. These activities may also be repeated at certain intervals to monitor changes in social risks.
  - Assessment/Diagnosis: These include activities where providers (clinical and community-based) and health plans analyze the data obtained through screening to determine a patientâ€™s social risks and needs.
  - Treatment/Interventions: These refer to actions undertaken by providers (clinical and community-based) and health plans to help address identified social needs. These include referrals, case management, care planning, counseling and education, and provision of services and orders.
- What the IG Does and What Systems it Involves?
  - Establishes a framework for SDOH-related interventions including:
    - capture of survey data from validated instruments
    - mapping the answers from the surveys into observations, conditions, and goals using SDOH-relevant value sets
    - generating and monitoring referrals from providers and care coordinators to CBOs
    - capturing the results of the referrals as procedures
  - Systems
    - EHR
    - CP
    - CBO Systems
    - Patient Applications
    - Eventually Payer systems?
- Dependencies and Relationships to Other IGs
  - Dependencies:
    - USCore
    - SDC
    - Subscriptions R5 Backport
    - VSAC
  - Related IGs
    - Human Services Directory
    - FAST for Registries?

*There is no explanation to this diagram, it is a littler premature, still haven't been introduced to these actors what does scope of interactions mean?*

1. Guidance on frequency of taking assesment
2. Standards for reporting quality measures
3. Addressing Consent beyond sharing to HIPPA

*Does this belong in background, is this out of scope for diagram2*
