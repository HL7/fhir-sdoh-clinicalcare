### Purpose
SDOH data is sensitive personal information with significant privacy and security considerations. The SDOHCC Consent profile is intended for authorizing disclosure of the subject of careâ€™s information between a HIPAA covered entity and a non-HIPAA covered entity (e.g., exchanged between a [Covered Entity](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/index.html) and a [Business Associate](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/index.html) (BA). This profile is not a complete treatment of the issues related to consent; it is a starting point to test the viability of exchanging consent information.
