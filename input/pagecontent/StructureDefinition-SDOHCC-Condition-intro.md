### ValueSet Binding Requirements
This profile defines constraints and requirements for Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) conditions across all domains and therefore does not define element bindings that are domain specific. Instead this profile defines a general code system level binding for `Condition.code` and enforces bindings through invariants based on the domain indicated in `Condition.category`. 

See the [Contextual Binding](#contextual-binding) section for a table of category ValueSet bindings.

See the [Support for Multiple Domains](support_for_multiple_domains.html) page for more information on how this guide uses ValueSets across the identified SDOH domains.
