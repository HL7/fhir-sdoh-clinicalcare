Information for Group

### Additional Guidance

The SDOHCC Group profile allows the aggregation of individuals that have a common set of characteristics (e.g. are all referred to the same food panty).  This will enable organizations that have permission to easily retrieve information related to the cohort of individuals for which they have a common responsibility. 
The section that follows provides additional guidance on some elements in the SDOHCC Group profile.

#### Group.identifier

Group.identifier should be used to provide an identifier that is recognized by the issuing organization for the specific group.

#### Group.code

Group.code does not currently have a specific binding to a value set.  We are seeking input an appropriate value set for this element.

#### Group.managingEntity

Group.managingEntity  is a reference to the entity that is responsible for managing the Group resource.  In general, Group.managingEntity should refer to the provider Organization.


#### Request for comments

Group.type
Group.actual
Group.characteristic
Group.characteristic.code
Group.member
