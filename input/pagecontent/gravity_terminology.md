### Gravity Terminology Development
The [Gravity Confluence Terminology Workstream](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Terminology+Workstream+Dashboard) has developed domain-specific value sets supporting the use of the profiles defined in this IG for SDOH data.  The value sets are maintained in the [NIH Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/) database, and are referenced in each profile where there use is mandated.

### Gravity Value Set Structure
The Figure below illustrates how the SDOH group value set is structured for the [SDOHCC Condition] Profile and reflects the general approach to the Gravity-developed value sets.
The [Social Determinants of Health Conditions Value Set](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1196.788/expansion) in VSAC aggregates or groups value sets for all of the supported SDOH domains.
