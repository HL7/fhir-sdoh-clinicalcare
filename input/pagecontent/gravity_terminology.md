### Gravity Terminology Development
For each SDOH domain/category (e.g., food insecurity, transportation insecurity), the Gravity Project has developed value sets to be used as preferred value sets for the [SDOHCC Observation Screening Response][SDOHCC Observation Screening Response], [SDOHCC Condition][SDOHCC Condition], [SDOHCC Service Request][SDOHCC Service Request], [SDOHCC Procedure][SDOHCC Procedure], and [SDOHCC Goal][SDOHCC Goal] profiles. For each of these profiles, the minimum value set bindings are specified in the profile. Additional guidance on the use of the Gravity-vetted, preferred value sets is provided in the Usage or Notes section of each profile.

Gravity Project value sets are published in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [NIH Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/) where they can be accessed by creating a free National Library of Medicine (NLM) account and refining the search by “Steward: The Gravity Project”. Hyperlinks to the VSAC value sets can also be found [here](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Gravity+Terminology+Value+Sets) on the Gravity Project Confluence site.

The [Gravity Confluence Terminology Workstream](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Terminology+Workstream+Dashboard) has developed domain-specific value sets supporting the use of the profiles defined in this IG for SDOH data.  The value sets are maintained in the [NIH Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/) database, and are referenced in each profile where there use is mandated.

### Gravity Value Set Structure
The Figure below illustrates how the SDOH group value set is structured for the [SDOHCC Condition] Profile and reflects the general approach to the Gravity-developed value sets.
The [Social Determinants of Health Conditions Value Set](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1196.788/expansion) in VSAC aggregates or groups value sets for all of the supported SDOH domains.
