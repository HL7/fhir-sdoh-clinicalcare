###  Underlying technologies
This guide is based on the [HL7 FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=491) standard. Implementers of this specification therefore need to understand some basic information about the FHIR specification.

**FHIR**

This implementation guide uses terminology, notations and design principles that are specific to FHIR. Before reading this implementation guide, itâ€™s important to be familiar with some of the basic principles of FHIR as well as general guidance on how to read FHIR specifications. Readers who are unfamiliar with FHIR are encouraged to read (or at least skim) the following prior to reading the rest of this implementation guide.

* 	[FHIR overview](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html)
* 	[Developers introduction (or Clinical introduction)](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview-dev.html)
* 	[FHIR data types](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html)
* 	[Using codes](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/codesystem.html)
* 	[References between resources](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html)
* 	[How to read [resource](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) & [profile](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html) definitions
* 	[Base resource](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/resource.html)

Implementers should also be familiar with the following implementation guides utilized by this specification:

* [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/)
* [Structured Data Capture](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/sdc/) 

This implementation guide supports the [R4 version](http://hl7.org/fhir/) of the FHIR standard. R4 is recently published and the goal is to ensure the implementation guide is aligned with the current direction of the FHIR standard.
