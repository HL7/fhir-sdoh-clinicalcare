### Purpose

SDOHCC ServiceRequest is generally intended to represent a service request to address an identified social risk or need (e.g., [SDOHCC Condition], [SDOHCC Observation Screening Response], [SDOHCC Observation Assessment]). An SDOHCC ServiceRequest can pertain to an [SDOHCC Goal], and can reference the patient’s consent for the referral (e.g., [SDOHCC Consent]). An SDOHCC ServiceRequest can be the focus of an [SDOHCC Task For Referral Management] and an [SDOHCC Procedure] can be an based on an SDOHCC ServiceRequest. See the [Data Modeling Framework] for more detail on the relationships between SDOHCC ServiceRequest and the other profiles in this IG.

### Usage

ServiceRequest.code has a binding to [US Core Procedure Codes]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}/ValueSet-us-core-procedure-code.html) ([required]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#required)). ServiceRequest.code also has additional bindings to SDOH domain-specific value sets (e.g., for Food Insecurity) which are determined by the value selected for ServiceRequest.category. When ServiceRequest.category is a value from [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category] (e.g., food-insecurity), ServiceRequest.code SHALL be selected from the corresponding domain-specific value set found in Additional Bindings (i.e. [Food Insecurity ServiceRequests](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.11/expansion/Latest). If more than one value is selected from [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category] (e.g., food-insecurity and financial-insecurity) for ServiceRequest.category, then ServiceRequest.code SHALL be selected from at least one of the corresponding domain-specific value sets found in Additional Bindings (e.g. [Food Insecurity ServiceRequests](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.11/expansion/Latest)).

Of note, Gravity Project is continuously developing terminology for new SDOH domains. Sometimes, a new SDOH domain may already be represented by a category code in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category], but a domain-specific value set may not yet be available in VSAC. In this case, the Additional Binding for the new SDOH domain/category is the default binding for the profile element. Additionally, sometimes a domain-specific value set for a new domain is available in VSAC but does not yet include all standardized codes identified during the domain’s terminology development cycle. In this case, the value set’s “Description” tab in VSAC will state, “In progress”. Additional information related to Gravity value sets is provided on the [Social Risk Terminology Value Sets](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Social+Risk+Terminology+Value+Sets) page on the Gravity Project Confluence site.

Additionally, some SDOH domains may not yet be represented in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category]. In this case, ServiceRequest.category: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified) can be used so that the Service Request instance can still be categorized as SDOH-related. If desired, category.text can also be used to further specify the domain. For example, at the time of publication of this IG, “disability-status” is not yet included in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category]. In this case, ServiceRequest.category: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified) can be used along with category.text: Disability Status. For ServiceRequest.category: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified), there will not be domain-specific value sets and Additional Bindings for ServiceRequest.code will designate the default binding to [US Core Procedure Codes]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}/ValueSet-us-core-procedure-code.html) ([required]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#required)).

For more information on the correlation between ServiceRequest.category and the domain-specific value sets in Additional Bindings for ServiceRequest.code, see [Gravity Project Value Sets](gravity_terminology.html#gravity-project-value-sets).

<!--Rather than offer a separate ServiceRequest profile for each SDOH category (also called domain – e.g., food insecurity, transportation insecurity), this profile can support any SDOH category. For ServiceRequest.code, the minimum value set bindings are specified in the profile. Additionally, based on the code selected for the optional ServiceRequest.category slice, the Table below provides the Gravity-vetted, preferred value sets for ServiceRequest.code. Where a preferred value set contains a code to describe a needed concept, servers SHOULD use that code.

The preferred value sets in the Table are hosted in the [NIH Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/). The [Social Determinants of Health Service Requests Value Set](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1196.790/expansion) in VSAC is a grouper value set containing all members of the VSAC Value Sets below. The Gravity Project plans to continue to work with the HL7 Vocabulary WG to determine how best to represent and validate these preferred, category-specific value sets.
