### Purpose

SDOHCC Procedure is generally intended to represent a procedure performed to address an identified social risk or need (e.g., [SDOHCC Condition], [SDOHCC Observation Screening Response], [SDOHCC Observation Assessment]). SDOHCC Procedure can be based on an [SDOHCC ServiceRequest], pertain to an [SDOHCC Goal], or be the output of an [SDOHCC Task For Referral Management]. See the [Data Modeling Framework] for more detail on the relationships between SDOHCC Procedure and the other profiles in this IG.

### Usage

Procedure.code has a binding to [US Core Procedure Codes]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}/ValueSet-us-core-procedure-code.html) ([required]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#required)). Procedure.code also has additional bindings to SDOH domain-specific value sets (e.g., for Food Insecurity) which are determined by the value selected for Procedure.category. When Procedure.category is a value from [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category] (e.g., food-insecurity), Procedure.code SHALL be selected from the corresponding domain-specific value set found in Additional Bindings (i.e. [Food Insecurity ServiceRequests](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.7/expansion/Latest). If more than one value is selected from [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category] (e.g., food-insecurity and financial-insecurity) for Procedure.category, then Procedure.code SHALL be selected from at least one of the corresponding domain-specific value sets found in Additional Bindings (e.g. [Food Insecurity ServiceRequests](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.7/expansion/Latest).

Of note, since Gravity Project terminology development for SDOH domains is an ongoing process, terminology development for some SDOH domains may be “in progress” - meaning sufficiently underway that the domain is included in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category] and corresponding domain-specific value sets are found in Additional Bindings for some, but not necessarily all, SDOHCC profiles. However, available value sets for an “in progress” domain may be less developed than for a “completed” domain. Where a corresponding domain-specific value set is not yet available, Additional Bindings for Procedure.code will designate the default binding to [US Core Procedure Codes]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}/ValueSet-us-core-procedure-code.html) ([required]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#required)). For additional information on value sets that are “in progress”, see [Social Risk Terminology Value Sets](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Social+Risk+Terminology+Value+Sets) on the Gravity Project Confluence site. Gravity is also in the process of adding information about a value set’s maturity level to the Metadata for Gravity’s VSAC value sets.

Additionally, some SDOH domains may not yet be represented in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category]. In this case, Procedure.category: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified) can be used so that the Procedure instance can still be categorized as SDOH-related. If desired, category.text can also be used to further specify the domain. For example, at the time of publication of this IG, “disability-status” is not yet included in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category]. In this case, Procedure.category: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified) can be used along with category.text: Disability Status. For Procedure.category: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified), there will not be domain-specific value sets and Additional Bindings for Procedure.code will designate the default binding to [US Core Procedure Codes]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}/ValueSet-us-core-procedure-code.html) ([required]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#required)).

For more information on the correlation between Procedure.category and the domain-specific value sets in Additional Bindings for Procedure.code, see [Gravity Project Value Sets](gravity_terminology.html#gravity-project-value-sets).

<!--Rather than offer a separate Procedure profile for each SDOH category (also called domain – e.g., food insecurity, transportation insecurity), this profile can support any SDOH category. For Procedure.code, the minimum value set bindings are specified in the profile. Additionally, based on the code selected for the optional Procedure.category.coding slice, the Table below provides the Gravity-vetted, preferred value sets for Procedure.code. Where a preferred value set contains a code to describe a needed concept, servers SHOULD use that code.

The preferred value sets in the Table are hosted in the [NIH Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/). The [Social Determinants of Health Procedures Value Set](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1196.789/expansion) in VSAC is a grouper value set containing all members of the VSAC Value Sets below. The Gravity Project plans to continue to work with the HL7 Vocabulary WG to determine how best to represent and validate these preferred, category-specific value sets.
