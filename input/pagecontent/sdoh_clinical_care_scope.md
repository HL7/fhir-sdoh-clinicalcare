### Conceptual Framework

Coded SDOH content is captured across core health care activities: screening/assessment, establishing health concerns, goal setting, care planning, interventions, outcomes and reporting. The conceptual framework, illustrated below, shows how these activities form a cycle of care. Over time, a patientâ€™s progress toward care goals can be tracked and measured.

### Scope of this IG

The focus for this version of the IG is to standardize the exchange of SDOH information related to the following activities:

* assessment of social risk,
* establishing coded health concerns/problems,
* creating patient driven goals, and
* defining a RESTful closed loop referral process to manage interventions.

####  Out of Scope

The following items are out of scope for this version of the IG.

* Providing guidance on the frequency of administering assessments (this is left up to the responsible organizations based on their standards of practice).
* Standards for reporting quality measures to payers or quality organizations (this is left to the [Data Exchange for Quality Measures Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/) that was co-authored by NCQA).
* Addressing Consent beyond the consent to share information between a HIPAA covered entity and entities that are not covered by HIPAA.
* Administrative activities such as eligibility checking, prior authorization, or billing for SDOH services.

### Scope of Interactions

The focus of this IG is interactions between a patient, provider, and CBO, with possible intermediation by a Coordination Platform (CP).  Provider EHRs and CPs will act as both clients and servers, accepting data from other systems and allowing it to be queried, while also storing data on and retrieving data from other systems.  Patient systems will act only as clients - accessing and sometimes manipulating data on other systems, but not exposing interfaces for other systems to interact with.The IG supports interactions with CBOs that support either a FHIR-enabled application (e.g. phone, tablet, web application) that queries other systems but does not expose its own data for query, or as a FHIR-Server Enabled application that exposes its own data for query and manipulation as well as querying and sometimes updating other systems.  In the drawing below, bidirectional solid arrows reflect communication between two endpoints with FHIR servers, whereas unidirectional solid arrows reflect FHIR API calls by a FHIR-enabled application against a FHIR server.

### Data Modeling Framework

The diagram below shows the data model for the assessment process including the creation of health concerns, goal setting (patient-centered goals), and creation of referrals using service request and procedure/intervention. The graphic represents key relationships defined in this IG for the [Questionnaire] and  [QuestionnaireResponse] resources, as well as the [SDOHCC Observation Screening Response], [SDOHCC Observation Assessment], [SDOHCC Condition], [SDOHCC Goal], [SDOHCC Task For Referral Management],  [SDOHCC ServiceRequest] and [SDOHCC Procedure] profiles.   For graphical clarity, only key references between profiles are shown (e.g., references to Patient profile are not shown).   Clicking on the profiles in the drawing will link to the defining specification.
