### SDOH, SDOH Data and the Gravity Project
### Why Social Determinants of Health Matter

The influence of social determinants on outcomes is increasingly recognized in emerging payment reform programs, federal and state-based policies, and information technology initiatives.  Social determinants of health (SDOH) are defined by the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/) as the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age.

The growing awareness around SDOH has contributed to efforts to address actionable social risk factors through the health care delivery system.  Recommendations from national groups, including the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/), [American Academy of Family Physicians](https://www.aafp.org/), [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality](https://www.ahrq.gov/), [National Quality Forum (NQF)](https://www.qualityforum.org/), and [Institute for Health Care Improvement](http://www.ihi.org/) underscore the various roles the health care system could play in helping to identify and address patients' social risks and needs.

There is growing awareness that SDOH information improves whole person care, lowers costs, and that unmet social needs negatively impact outcomes. For example:
* Food insecurity correlates with higher levels of diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure
* Housing instability factors into lower treatment adherence
* Transportation barriers result in missed appointments, delayed care, and lower medication compliance

Addressing SDOH is a primary approach to achieve health equity. See National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) Social Determinants of Health, [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/socialdeterminants/faq.html)

These national calls to action for health care systems have spurred innovations, including a wide range of social risk screening tools and practice-based interventions.   Some of these innovations have helped to reduce social risks, improve outcomes, and lower costs.   The experimentation in this area has been bolstered by new value-based payment models and accountable care organizations (ACOs), which together offer financial incentives to advance coordinated care between medical and social service organizations and other organizations directly connected to patients.


### Gravity Project Overview
The [Gravity Project](https://thegravityproject.net/) was initiated by the [Social Interventions Research and Evaluation Network (SIREN)](https://chc.ucsf.edu/siren) with support from the [Robert Wood Johnson Foundation](https://www.rwjf.org/) and joined the [HL7 FHIR Accelerator Program](http://www.hl7.org/about/fhir-accelerator/) in 2019.   For more information about Gravity see the Gravity project [website](https://thegravityproject.net/) or [confluence site](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Join+the+Gravity+Project).

The Gravity Project currently has three workstreams as shown in the figure above.  The Terminology Workstream develops terminology resources that are published via VSAC that support capture of SDOH-related data.  The Technical workstream developed this FHIR Implementation guide and coordinates with other FHIR IG development projects.  The Pilot testing workstream tests the Gravity-developed Terminologies and FHIR IG specifications with partners to assess their usefulness, and drive improvements.
