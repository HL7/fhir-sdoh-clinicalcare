### Purpose

[SDOHCC Goal] is generally intended to represent a goal established to address an identified social risk or need (e.g., [SDOHCC Condition], [SDOHCC Observation Screening Response], [SDOHCC Observation Assessment]). An [SDOHCC ServiceRequest] and [SDOHCC Procedure] can pertain to an SDOHCC Goal. See the [Data Modeling Framework] for more detail on the relationships between SDOHCC Goal and the other profiles in this IG.

### Usage

`Goal.description` has a binding to [US Core Goal Codes]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}/ValueSet-us-core-goal-description.html) ([extensible]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#extensible)). `Goal.description` also has additional bindings to SDOH domain-specific value sets (e.g., for Food Insecurity) which are determined by the value selected for `Goal.category`. When `Goal.category` is a value from [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category](ValueSet-SDOHCC-ValueSetSDOHCategory.html) (e.g., food-insecurity), `Goal.description` **SHALL** be selected from the corresponding domain-specific value set found in Additional Bindings (i.e. [Food Insecurity Goals](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.16/expansion/Latest)). If more than one value is selected from [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category](ValueSet-SDOHCC-ValueSetSDOHCategory.html) (e.g., food-insecurity **and** financial-insecurity) for `Goal.category`, then `Goal.description` **SHALL** be selected from at least one of the corresponding domain-specific value sets found in Additional Bindings (e.g. [Food Insecurity Goals](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.16/expansion/Latest)).

Of note, Gravity Project is continuously developing terminology for new SDOH domains. Sometimes, a new SDOH domain may already be represented by a category code in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category](ValueSet-SDOHCC-ValueSetSDOHCategory.html), but a domain-specific value set may not yet be available in VSAC. In this case, the Additional Binding for the new SDOH domain/category is the default binding for the profile element. Additionally, sometimes a domain-specific value set for a new domain is available in VSAC but does not yet include all standardized codes identified during the domain’s terminology development cycle. In this case, the value set’s “Description” tab in VSAC will state, “In progress”.  Additional information related to Gravity value sets is provided on the [Social Risk Terminology Value Sets](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Social+Risk+Terminology+Value+Sets) page on the Gravity Project Confluence site.

Additionally, some SDOH domains may not yet be represented in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category](ValueSet-SDOHCC-ValueSetSDOHCategory.html). In this case, `Goal.category`: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified) can be used so that the Goal instance can still be categorized as SDOH-related. If desired, `Goal.category.text` can also be used to further specify the domain. For example, at the time of publication of this IG, “disability-status” is not yet included in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category](ValueSet-SDOHCC-ValueSetSDOHCategory.html). In this case, `Goal.category`: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified) can be used along with `Goal.category.text`: Disability Status. For `Goal.category`: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified), there will not be domain-specific value sets and Additional Bindings for `Goal.description` will designate the default binding to [US Core Goal Codes]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}/ValueSet-us-core-goal-description.html) ([extensible]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#extensible)).

For more information on the correlation between `Goal.category` and the domain-specific value sets in Additional Bindings for `Goal.description`, see [Gravity Project Value Sets](gravity_terminology.html#gravity-project-value-sets).


<!--Rather than offer a separate Goal profile for each SDOH category (also called domain – e.g., food insecurity, transportation insecurity), this profile can support any SDOH category. For `Goal.description`, the minimum value set bindings are specified in the profile. Additionally, based on the code selected for the optional `Goal.category` slice, the Table below provides the Gravity-vetted, preferred value sets for `Goal.description`. Where a preferred value set contains a code to describe a needed concept, servers **SHOULD** use that code.

The preferred value sets in the Table are hosted in the [NIH Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/). [Social Determinants of Health Goals Value Set](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.71/expansion) in VSAC is a grouper value set containing all members of the VSAC Value Sets below. The Gravity Project plans to continue to work with the HL7 Vocabulary WG to determine how best to represent and validate these preferred, category-specific value sets.
