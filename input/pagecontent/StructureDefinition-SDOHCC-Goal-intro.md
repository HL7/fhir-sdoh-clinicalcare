### Purpose

[SDOHCC Goal] is generally intended to represent a goal established to address an identified social risk or need (e.g., [SDOHCC Condition], [SDOHCC Observation Screening Response], [SDOHCC Observation Assessment]). An [SDOHCC ServiceRequest] and [SDOHCC Procedure] can pertain to an SDOHCC Goal. See the [Data Modeling Framework] for more detail on the relationships between SDOHCC Goal and the other profiles in this IG.

### Usage

Goal.description has a binding to [SDOHCC ValueSet LOINC SNOMEDCT](ValueSet-SDOHCC-ValueSetLOINCSNOMEDCT.html) ([preferred]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#preferred)). Goal.description also has additional bindings to SDOH domain-specific value sets (e.g., for Food Insecurity) which are determined by the value selected for Goal.category. When Goal.category is a value from [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category] (e.g., food-insecurity), Goal.description SHALL be selected from the corresponding domain-specific value set found in Additional Bindings (i.e. [Food Insecurity Goals](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.16/expansion/Latest)). If more than one value is selected from [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category] (e.g., food-insecurity **and** financial-insecurity) for Goal.category, then Goal.description SHALL be selected from at least one of the corresponding domain-specific value sets found in Additional Bindings (e.g. [Food Insecurity Goals](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.16/expansion/Latest)).

Of note, since Gravity Project terminology development for SDOH domains is an ongoing process, terminology development for some SDOH domains may be “in progress” - meaning sufficiently underway that the domain is included in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category] and corresponding domain-specific value sets are found in Additional Bindings for some, but not necessarily all, SDOHCC profiles. However, available value sets for an “in progress” domain may be less developed than for a “completed” domain. Where a corresponding domain-specific value set is not yet available, Additional Bindings for Goal.description will designate the default binding to [SDOHCC ValueSet LOINC SNOMEDCT](ValueSet-SDOHCC-ValueSetLOINCSNOMEDCT.html) ([preferred]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#preferred)). For additional information on value sets that are “in progress”, see [Social Risk Terminology Value Sets](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Social+Risk+Terminology+Value+Sets) on the Gravity Project Confluence site. Gravity is also in the process of adding information about a value set’s maturity level to the Metadata for Gravity’s VSAC value sets.

Additionally, some SDOH domains may not yet be represented in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category]. In this case, Goal.category: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified) can be used so that the Goal instance can still be categorized as SDOH-related. If desired, category.text can also be used to further specify the domain. For example, at the time of publication of this IG, “disability-status” is not yet included in [SDOHCC ValueSet SDOH Category]. In this case, Goal.category: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified) can be used along with category.text: Disability Status. For Goal.category: [sdoh-category-unspecified](CodeSystem-SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes.html#SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes-sdoh-category-unspecified), there will not be domain-specific value sets and Additional Bindings for Goal.description will designate the default binding to [SDOHCC ValueSet LOINC SNOMEDCT](ValueSet-SDOHCC-ValueSetLOINCSNOMEDCT.html) ([preferred]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#preferred)).

For more information on the correlation between Goal.category and the domain-specific value sets in Additional Bindings for Goal.description, see [Gravity Project Value Sets](gravity_terminology.html#gravity-value-sets).


<!--Rather than offer a separate Goal profile for each SDOH category (also called domain – e.g., food insecurity, transportation insecurity), this profile can support any SDOH category. For Goal.description, the minimum value set bindings are specified in the profile. Additionally, based on the code selected for the optional Goal.category slice, the Table below provides the Gravity-vetted, preferred value sets for Goal.description. Where a preferred value set contains a code to describe a needed concept, servers SHOULD use that code.

The preferred value sets in the Table are hosted in the [NIH Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/). [Social Determinants of Health Goals Value Set](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1247.71/expansion) in VSAC is a grouper value set containing all members of the VSAC Value Sets below. The Gravity Project plans to continue to work with the HL7 Vocabulary WG to determine how best to represent and validate these preferred, category-specific value sets.
