### Deleted
This section has been deleted.   The explanation of the approach to supporting multiple SDOH domains/categories within the Procedure, Goal, Condition, ServiceRequest and Observation profiles has been moved to the intro to each profile.   The referenced value sets are now emumerated in the profiles directly, rather than through the [supplemental guide](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Supplemental+Guide) and this section.
