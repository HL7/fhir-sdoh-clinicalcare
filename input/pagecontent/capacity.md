This use case addresses the need for a referring entity to determine if a Community-Based Organization (CBO) has the capacity to accept a referral before the referral is formally sent. This "pre-flight" check aims to reduce the administrative burden on clinical staff and CBOs by preventing referrals to organizations that cannot currently provide services. It also improves care coordination by making all involved parties aware of a CBO's capacity status.

Once capacity is confirmed and a referral is initiated, implementers should follow the guidance outlined in the existing Closed-Loop Referral Workflow page.

### Scope

The scope of this use case is to define the exchange of information regarding a CBO's capacity to provide social care services. This implementation guide focuses specifically on the most direct and simple workflow to allow the community an opportunity to implement and provide feedback before addressing more complex scenarios.

#### In Scope

- Direct Capacity Status Check: This is a one-to-one query where a Referral Source or, more commonly, a Coordinating Platform queries a specific CBO about its capacity. This query may be repeated with multiple CBOs until one with available capacity is found, at which point the referral process is completed. This is the primary workflow supported in STU 3.0.
    - This workflow supports two primary types of capacity checks:
        - Capacity to Assess: Checking an organization's general availability to assess an individual for any health-related social need.
        - Program or Service-Specific Capacity: Checking an organization's capacity to provide a specific service, such as assistance with a program application (e.g., SNAP, HUD), eligibility evaluation, or direct service provision.
- Post-Referral Capacity Status Notification: A scenario where a CBO, after receiving a referral, communicates that it is unable to accept the patient because it is at capacity. This provides transparency and can support broader analysis of social care resource shortages in a community.

#### Out of Scope

- Bulk Capacity Status Check: A "broadcast" or "Uber model" workflow where a Referral Source sends a single capacity request to multiple CBOs simultaneously and selects the first available respondent. This is out of scope for STU 3.0.
- Directory-Mediated Capacity Status Check: A workflow where a Referral Source or Coordinating Platform checks for capacity within one or more centralized service provider directories. This is out of scope for STU 3.0.
- Contractual Capacity Reporting: This use case does not cover high-level, aggregate capacity reporting that may occur as part of a contractual obligation between organizations (e.g., a quarterly report on service level agreements).

### Actors and System Environments

#### Actors

This use case uses the existing actors defined in this Implementation Guide: Referral Source, Coordinating Platform, and Community-Based Organization (CBO).
The most common scenario anticipated involves an indirect referral, where the Referral Source sends a referral to a Coordinating Platform. The Coordinating Platform then takes on the responsibility of checking for capacity with one or more CBOs before forwarding the referral.
While less common, this guidance also supports the scenario where a Referral Source directly queries a CBO for its capacity status.

#### System Environments

The interactions between actors can occur in different system environments. This IG is designed to support data exchange in Open and Hybrid systems.

- Closed System: The Referral Source, Coordinating Platform, and CBO all use the same system or platform. In this environment, capacity status is generally known across all actors without the need for a standards-based exchange. Closed systems are out of scope for this guide.
- Open System: The Referral Source, Coordinating Platform, and CBO each use disparate systems that cannot natively interoperate. To share information like capacity, a standards-based exchange using FHIR is required. Open systems are in scope.
- Hybrid System: Some trading partners use the same system, while others use different systems. A standards-based exchange is still necessary to communicate capacity status across the disparate system boundaries. Hybrid systems are in scope.

### Exchange Flows

#### Pre-Referral Capacity Inquiry Workflow

This workflow occurs before the initiation of a formal referral to a CBO. It is designed as a general query for service availability and assumes that no identifying information about the individual is exchanged. Consent workflows, as described elsewhere in this guide, are expected to take place after a successful capacity check when the formal referral is being prepared.

1. Referral Source Initiates an Indirect Referral: The workflow begins when a Referral Source sends a referral to a Coordinating Platform, following the process described in the Closed-Loop Referral Workflow.
2. Coordinating Platform Searches for CBO Services and Capacity: Upon receiving the referral, the Coordinating Platform searches for an appropriate CBO with the capacity to fulfill the request. Typically, the Coordinating Platform uses its own internal resource directory for this search. In the future, this step could be integrated with standards-based directories, such as the FaST National Directory for Healthcare Providers and Services. The platform queries one or more CBOs by performing a FHIR search on the HealthcareService resource.
3. CBO System Responds with Capacity Status: The CBO system returns a Bundle containing HealthcareService resources that match the query criteria.
- Each HealthcareService resource in the response MUST indicate its current capacity status.
- The capacity status can be one of the following: Yes, No, or Waitlist Available.
- If a waitlist is available, the IG supports optional, coarse-grained time frames (e.g., < 1 month, 1-3 months, >3 months, undetermined) to provide additional context.
- [Add an “additional information” element for waitlist information]
4. Coordinating Platform Completes the Referral: If the queried CBO has capacity, the Coordinating Platform forwards the referral to that CBO. If the CBO is at capacity, the Coordinating Platform repeats Steps 2 and 3 with other CBOs until a suitable partner is found. This completes the capacity-check portion of the workflow, and the process continues as described in the Closed-Loop Referral Workflow.


#### Post-Referral Capacity Status Notification Workflow
This workflow occurs when a CBO rejects an existing referral due to being at capacity. It is an extension of the Closed-Loop Referral Workflow. When a CBO determines it cannot fulfill a received referral request due to lack of capacity, its system updates the corresponding Task resource. The Task.status is changed to rejected, and Task.statusReason is populated with a CodeableConcept to indicate that the rejection is due to the organization being at capacity.

### FHIR Resources and Profiles
This use case primarily leverages the HealthcareService resource, with Task being used in the post-referral scenario.
HealthcareService: This use case leverages and extends the existing SDOHCC HealthcareService profile to advertise a CBO's services and their associated capacity.
Purpose: To describe a specific service offered by a CBO at a location, including details about programs it supports.
Key Profiled Elements: The SDOHCC HealthcareService profile is modified in the following ways to support this use case:
An extension is added to convey the capacity-status.
The program element is used to associate the service with specific social care programs using a standard terminology value set.
The category element is constrained with an SDOHCC slice to indicate the specific SDOH domain of the service (e.g., food-insecurity, housing-insecurity).
The type element is profiled to differentiate between a service for "Capacity to Assess" and one for "Program or Service-Specific Capacity".
The characteristic element is used to provide more granular details about the service by pointing to specific terminology concepts.
Organization: This resource is referenced by HealthcareService.providedBy to identify the CBO or other entity that provides the service.
Task: In the post-referral workflow, this resource is used to communicate that a referral was rejected specifically due to the CBO being at capacity.
