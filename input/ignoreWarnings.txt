# WARNING: Reference Versioning
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-practitioner'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '7.0.0', found versions: 3.1.1, 6.1.0, 7.0.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-practitioner' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-practitioner|7.0.0'

# WARNING: US Core Variance - https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-48706 - Variance renewal for SDOH Clinical Care Condition (Is based on US Core, but on a profile that does not exist in the latest US Core version)
%US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Condition derive from one of the base US profiles. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process%

# WARNING: US Core Variance - https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-48709 - Variance renewal for SDOH Clinical Care Procedure (Is based on US Core, but on a profile that does not exist in the latest US Core version)

# INFORMATION: Deprecated pattern slicing from an inherited US Core profile
%The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# INFORMATION: Deprecated extension for Condition.language from an inherited R4 profile
%The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# WARNING: The Gravity SDOH Clinical Care IG is based on US Core 7.0.0. Considerations to move to US Core 8.0.0 were not made for this version of the guide, but will be for future versions
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#7.0.0 released on 2024-05-08, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

This IG is version 4.0.1, while the IG 'hl7.fhir.uv.subscriptions-backport.r4' is from version 4.0.0
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 4.0.1 but package hl7.fhir.uv.subscriptions-backport.r4#1.1.0 is based on FHIR version 4.0.0. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
