# US Core Variance Warnings


# WARNING: US Core Variance - https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-48706Â - Variance renewal for SDOH Clinical Care Condition (Is based on US Core, but on a profile that does not exist in the latest US Core version)
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/sdoh-clinicalcare/StructureDefinition/SDOHCC-Condition').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Condition derive from one of the base US profiles. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process



# WARNING: US Core has extensible Condition.category binding across all slices. Examples have a category in that VS, but also add an SDOH category, which is triggering this warning (this issue was addressed in later versions of US Core).
WARNING: Condition/SDOHCC-ConditionAsserterDeviceExample: Condition: Constraint failed: us-core-1: 'A code in Condition.category SHOULD be from US Core Condition Category Codes value set.' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition) (Best Practice Recommendation)
WARNING: Condition/SDOHCC-ConditionFoodInsecurityExample: Condition: Constraint failed: us-core-1: 'A code in Condition.category SHOULD be from US Core Condition Category Codes value set.' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition) (Best Practice Recommendation)
WARNING: Condition/SDOHCC-ConditionHomelessExample: Condition: Constraint failed: us-core-1: 'A code in Condition.category SHOULD be from US Core Condition Category Codes value set.' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition) (Best Practice Recommendation)
WARNING: Condition/SDOHCC-ConditionUnemployedExample: Condition: Constraint failed: us-core-1: 'A code in Condition.category SHOULD be from US Core Condition Category Codes value set.' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition) (Best Practice Recommendation)
