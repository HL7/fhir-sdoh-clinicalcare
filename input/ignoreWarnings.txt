# WARNING: Reference Versioning
%There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-organization'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '7.0.0', found versions: 3.1.1, 6.1.0, 7.0.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-organization' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-organization|7.0.0'
