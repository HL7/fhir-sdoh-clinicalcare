# INFORMATION: Deprecated pattern slicing from an inherited US Core profile
%The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

%The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated



# WARNING: US Core has extensible Condition.category binding across all slices. Examples have a category in that VS, but also add an SDOH category, which is triggering this warning (this issue was addressed in later versions of US Core).

# INFORMATION: Example resources that do not need to have OIDs assigns
INFORMATION: Resource: The resource Questionnaire/SDOHCC-QuestionnaireHungerVitalSign could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)
INFORMATION: Resource: The resource Questionnaire/SDOHCC-QuestionnairePRAPARE could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)

# INFORMATION: Current release is guidance only. Will look at creating a THO URL, or move to THO or VSAC in a future major release
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/SDOHCC-CodeSystemTemporaryCodes: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
